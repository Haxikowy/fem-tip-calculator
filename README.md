## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript ES6+

### What I learned

Basically I grinded my HTML & CSS & JS skills. In CSS most trouble causing for me was grid - learned it a lot. Next thing in CSS that I learned is selectors, I thought I understand it, but the truth was slightly different. In JS I had a lot of trouble about form validation I learned that if I use

```js
someFormElement.reset();
```

and I have event listener, listening for 'change' it doesn't actually cause any change event so I need to do it 'manually'. I started adding a lot of comments in my JS - it improves readability a lot! I know that JavaScript side of this project is weakest, I will improve and change this project in future.

### Continued development

In future I will definetly focus on JavaScript side form validation - I haven't learned a lot about it --- need to make it up. I still need to learn about JavaScripts' paradigms - I like a lot the functional paradigm.
